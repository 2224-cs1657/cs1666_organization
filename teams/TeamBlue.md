## Game Description

In this brawling game, the user plays as an old man set in a suburban area, dealing with everyday life annoyances, conversing with his neighbors as any great neighbor would, etc. However, based on his interaction with a fellow character, a fight could commence between the two. These fights could be avoided based on the response the user inputs, i.e a positive, friendly response would keep both characters at bay. But anything the AI sees as being aggressive or rude will begin the fighting sequence. The game is set in levels, defeating an opponent will progress the user to the next level and so on. The user must also watch out for any damage taken while progressing, health will be limited: once you die, GAME OVER.

## Advanced Topic Description

### Artificial Intelligence: Conversation

The chat interaction between players and opponents should be driven by AI logic, this includes processing and categorizing text responses from the player and choosing an appropriate response from a set of options.
    
### Artificial Intelligence: Fighting

The fight between the main character and the opponent will be a arcade based style of combat. The enemy AI should be responsive to multiple factors such as user input, distance from the player, current health, etc.

## Midterm Goals

* Create one working level with both the conversation and fighting aspects functional
* AI will pick random choices until the AI teams make an alternative.

## Final Goals

* 30%: Adjust fighting AI to be more complex, responsive, and easily changeable (this way we can use an AI at Level 1 and reuse it later, just with edited difficulty)
* 30%: Improve conversational AI to successfully assess the aggressiveness of user-input text; characters respond based on AI evaluated aggressiveness level
* 20%: Creating a base level that contains, a simple AI for chatting, and an AI for battling
* 10%: Have the conversation/fighting functional for at least 5 enemies with an arcade-style of progression

## Stretch Goals

* Creating a larger map with more iteration / battles for the user
* Items can be used in battle that relate to each character battled
